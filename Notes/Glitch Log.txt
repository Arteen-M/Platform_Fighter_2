Version 2:

Unresolved Glitches:
4. When entering new controls, the text appears off center, but corrects once the page is refreshed or closed
6. The game exists


Possible Solutions/ Problems:
4. The rect isn't being centered like it should on input, but it is when read from the file
6. Delete the game

Discovered Glitches:
1. Observed in Normal Gameplay (Single Player Testing)
2. Observed in Normal Gameplay (Multi Player Testing)
3. Observed in Normal Gameplay (Multi PLayer Testing)
4. Observed in Menu Navigation (Single Player Testing)
5. Observed through theory-crafting (Single Player Testing)

Fixed Glitches:
1. When landing, two attacks could be used at once.
2. When a player presses/ holds an attack key, some key combinations stop working for the opponent
3. Players hitboxes linger after being hit
5. Vertical knockback is canceled by fast falling

Problems:
1. Landing resets your lag and the active hitbox, but if you timed the landing in the startup frames,
it wouldn't reset, allowing you to attack with two attacks at once.
2. Two special character inputs don't seem to work well together in pygame (further testing is required)
3. Hitboxes and their attributes didn't reset after getting hit
5. Fast falling overrides knockback velocity and wasn't limited by lag or hitstun or momentum

Solutions:
1. Check all hitboxes to see if they're running when they land. If they are, reset them, along with
the other reset conditions
2. No Solution (remove access to special characters entirely?)
3. Reset all hitboxes and clear the active hitbox sprite group
5. Limit fast falling to only a neutral state
